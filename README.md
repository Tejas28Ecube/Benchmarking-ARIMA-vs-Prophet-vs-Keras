# Benchmarking-ARIMA-vs-Prophet-vs-Keras
This project is a demonstration of benchmarking ARIMA vs Prophet vs Keras for TS forecasting. It shows that when techniques like ARIMA fail completely, Keras and Prophet work reasonably well. Among the two also, Prophet scores in ease of use and higher performance.
